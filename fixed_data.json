During the follicular phase (days 1-14), low to moderate intensity aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, and swimming are beneficial as estrogen levels rise, enhancing energy levels and endurance. In the ovulatory phase (around day 14), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or strength training can be effective, capitalizing on peak energy and strength levels. In the luteal phase (days 15-28), focusing on yoga, Pilates, and lower-intensity workouts helps manage premenstrual symptoms and stress, while supporting the body's natural hormonal shifts. Listening to the body's cues and adjusting intensity accordingly is key throughout the cycle."
