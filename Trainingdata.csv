How long does the follicular phase usually last?,"The follicular phase typically lasts about 14 days, although it can vary from person to person."
What is ovulation?,"Ovulation is the process by which a mature egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube, where it may be fertilized by sperm if intercourse occurs."

What happens during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?,"During the luteal phase, the ruptured follicle transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Progesterone prepares the uterine lining for possible implantation of a fertilized egg."
How long does the luteal phase typically last?,"The luteal phase typically lasts about 14 days, although its length can vary slightly among individuals."
What triggers menstruation in the menstrual cycle?,"Menstruation is triggered by a drop in progesterone levels if fertilization and implantation of an egg do not occur. This drop in hormone levels causes the uterine lining to shed, resulting in menstrual bleeding."
How long does menstruation typically last?,"Menstruation typically lasts for about 3 to 7 days, although the duration can vary from person to person."
Are there any changes in hormone levels during menstruation?,"yes, hormone levels, particularly estrogen and progesterone, fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, with specific patterns during each phase. Estrogen levels rise during the follicular phase, peak just before ovulation, and decline during the luteal phase if pregnancy does not occur."
what are the phases of menstrual cycle,"The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, the luteal phase, and menstruation. During the follicular phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates follicles in the ovary to mature. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase follows ovulation, during which the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum and secretes progesterone. If fertilization does not occur, the uterine lining sheds during menstruation, marking the end of the cycle."
what is the ideal diet for each phase of menstrual cycle,"During the menstrual cycle, dietary needs may vary across phases. In the follicular phase, focus on iron-rich foods like leafy greens and lean meats to replenish iron lost during menstruation. Prioritize complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and legumes to maintain energy levels. Incorporate foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon and flaxseeds to help alleviate menstrual cramps. During ovulation, emphasize foods high in antioxidants like berries and vegetables to support egg health. In the luteal phase, include calcium-rich foods like dairy and leafy greens to ease premenstrual symptoms. Stay hydrated and limit caffeine and processed foods throughout the cycle for overall health."
what is the ideal exercise for each phase of menstrual cycle,"The ideal exercise varies across the phases of the menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase (days 1-14), low to moderate intensity aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, and swimming are beneficial as estrogen levels rise, enhancing energy levels and endurance. In the ovulatory phase (around day 14), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or strength training can be effective, capitalizing on peak energy and strength levels. In the luteal phase (days 15-28), focusing on yoga, Pilates, and lower-intensity workouts helps manage premenstrual symptoms and stress, while supporting the body's natural hormonal shifts. Listening to the body's cues and adjusting intensity accordingly is key throughout the cycle."
